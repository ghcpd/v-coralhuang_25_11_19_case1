User: ## Prompt

You are a web developer working inside a persistent code execution session with full filesystem access to the current working directory.
All modifications must be applied **in-place** to files in the current directory (do not create separate project roots unless strictly necessary).

---

## Goal

Build a modern, responsive **product browsing and search UI** and set up a **reusable environment** with **one-click testing**.

The UI should:

* Display a list/grid of product cards (name, price, short description).
* Allow searching products by a text input (filtering the list).
* Optionally support a category filter and/or sort by price.
* Show a loading state when applying filters (simulated is fine).
* Show a friendly empty state when no products match.
* Look visually modern and clean, with good spacing, typography, and hierarchy.

Work iteratively: **plan → edit → run → verify → refine**.
Keep each code change minimal, explain what you changed, and ensure the application runs successfully after each step.

---

## Workspace

* Work in the **current directory**.
* Ignore any `.git` folder.
* Detect project type:

  * If React/Next.js files are created, treat it as a **Next.js app**.
  * If only HTML/CSS/JS is needed, treat it as a **static HTML app**.

---

## Entrypoints

* Next.js app: `app/page.tsx` (create if missing).
* Static HTML app: `index.html` (create if missing).

---

## Dev Server Rules

### Next.js

* Start:
  `nohup yarn dev -p 3000 > /tmp/nextjs.log 2>&1 &`
* Verify HTTP 200 at `http://localhost:3000`.
* If errors occur:

  * Inspect logs: `tail -n 200 /tmp/nextjs.log`.
  * Fix and retry until the server starts successfully.

### Static HTML

* Start:
  `nohup python3 -m http.server 3000 > /tmp/html.log 2>&1 &`
* Verify HTTP 200 at `http://localhost:3000`.
* If errors occur:

  * Inspect logs: `tail -n 100 /tmp/html.log`.
  * Fix and retry.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Understand & Plan**

   * Restate the requested UI and features.
   * Decide whether to use Next.js or static HTML.
   * List the key files you will create or modify.

2. **Setup / Inspection**

   * If using Next.js, ensure a minimal `package.json` and required config exist.
   * If using static HTML, ensure `index.html` exists and is loadable.
   * Do not introduce unnecessary files.

3. **Implementation**

   * Edit or create files incrementally.
   * Keep edits small and focused.
   * Use clean, semantic HTML, and either Tailwind CSS or well-structured CSS.
   * Ensure JavaScript/TypeScript builds without errors.

4. **Run & Verify**

   * Start or restart the appropriate dev server.
   * Confirm `http://localhost:3000` returns HTTP 200.
   * Manually verify:

     * Product list renders.
     * Search/filter behavior works.
     * Loading and empty states appear appropriately.

5. **UI/UX Polish**

   * Make the layout responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).
   * Use a clear visual hierarchy, consistent spacing, and modern styling.
   * Add smooth transitions for interactions (hover, filter changes).
   * Ensure accessibility basics (labels, semantic elements).

---

## Reusable Environment & Automation

You must create the following **reusable scripts** in the current directory:

* `setup.sh`

  * Install all required dependencies.
  * Prepare the environment so the app and tests can run on a clean machine.

* `run.sh`

  * Start the dev server on port 3000 for manual inspection.
  * Detect whether the project is Next.js or static HTML and start the appropriate server.

* `test.sh`

  * Run a non-interactive test flow:

    * Ensure dependencies are installed (or call `setup.sh`).
    * Start the server.
    * Wait for it to be ready.
    * Make HTTP requests (e.g., with `curl`) to verify:

      * The server returns HTTP 200 for `/`.
      * The HTML contains expected UI elements (e.g., search input, product card container).
    * Exit with a non-zero status code if checks fail.

* `Dockerfile`

  * Define a reproducible environment.
  * Install dependencies.
  * Copy the project into the image.
  * Run `test.sh` as the container’s main command (or in `CMD`/entrypoint).
  * The container build + run should pass when the app is correctly implemented.

---

## Deliverables

By the end, you must produce:

1. A fully functional web UI available at port 3000
2. Automation files:

   * `setup.sh`
   * `run.sh`
   * `test.sh`
   * `Dockerfile`
3. A **README.md** documenting:

   * Overview of project
   * How the UI works
   * How to run `setup.sh`, `run.sh`, `test.sh`
   * How to build/run the Docker image
   * Any caveats or design decisions
4. A brief changelog describing:

   * Files created
   * Files modified
   * Key choices made in implementation


---

## Important Notes

* Always analyze the user request before modifying files.
* Maintain syntax correctness and fix compile/runtime errors immediately.
* Ensure the server on port 3000 is reachable and stable before considering the task done.
* Do not fake test results: `test.sh` and the Docker image must exercise the real running app.

## ✅ Overview  
Modern static **Product Browser** with search, category filter, price sorting, simulated loading, and empty state. Tailwind CDN; no build step required.

---

## 📁 Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| index.html | Responsive UI (search, filters, loading, empty state) |
| setup.sh | Install deps; ensure `python3`/`curl`; yarn if Next.js detected |
| run.sh | Start static server (or Next.js if present) on port `3000` |
| test.sh | One-click test: setup → start server → curl checks |
| Dockerfile | Reproducible env; runs test.sh |
| README.md | Usage, features, scripts, Docker |
| CHANGELOG.md | Summary of changes |

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Scripts assume a Unix-like shell; on Windows, use WSL/Git Bash
- Logs: `/tmp/html.log` (static) or `/tmp/nextjs.log` (Next.js)
- Original input.html remains; index.html is the entrypoint
